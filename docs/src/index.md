# SDDP

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/odow/SDDP.jl.svg?token=BjRx6YCjMdN19LP812Rj&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/odow/SDDP.jl)

## Installation
This package is unregistered so you will need to `Pkg.clone` it as follows:
```julia
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/odow/SDDP.jl.git")
```

## Note

The documentation is still very incomplete, and the internals of the library need a tidy and a refactor, however the user-facing API from the examples should be stable enough to use.
